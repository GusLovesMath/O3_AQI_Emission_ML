# Ozone AQI Trends Project

## Important Viewing Information
For the best viewing experience, especially due to the size and complexity of the notebook, please view this project on Kaggle or download the notebooks.
- **Project Proposal Notebook**: [Proposal on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/guslovesmath/o3-aqi-trends-in-high-impact-regions-proposal)
- **Main Project Notebook**: [Project on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/guslovesmath/o3-aqi-trends-in-high-impact-regions-project)

## Overview

This repository hosts notebooks and data for analyzing Ground-level Ozone (O3) Air Quality Index (AQI) trends in critical U.S. regions from 2000 to 2023. The project aims to offer insights into O3 pollution to support informed environmental policy-making.

## Data
- The data, initially compiled by BrendaSo and ANGELA KIM, was further enriched by me for the years 2021-2023.

## Notebooks

### Detailed Analysis Notebooks:
1. **Project Proposal Notebook**
   - Initial proposal with preliminary EDA and regression analysis of O3 emission trends.
2. **Main Project Notebook**
   - Comprehensive analysis including:
     - Detailed EDA and trend analysis from 2000-2023
     - Data transformation, train-test split for forecasting
     - Grid search for hyperparameter tuning, ACF and PACF analysis
     - Forecasting using ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Holt-Winters methods

## Project Summary

The O3 pollution project delivers actionable insights through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced time-series modeling techniques. These insights are documented in two primary notebooks.
